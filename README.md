This is a fork of [GitGraph.js](https://github.com/nicoespeon/gitgraph.js)

Made changes to the original [GitGraph.js](https://github.com/nicoespeon/gitgraph.js) package to take commit info from [DoltHub](https://wwww.dolthub.com).

The changes have been implemented in two sub-packages: core and react. Before publishing the package, it is necessary to execute the yarn build command within the package to generate the ./lib directory.
